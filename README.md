# branch "react-native-walkthrough-tooltip"

## Advantages
- Offers customizable styling options (e.g., arrowStyle, backgroundStyle, contentStyle, tooltipStyle) to match the app's design seamlessly.
- Provides multiple placement options (top, bottom, left, right, center) for flexible positioning relative to target elements.
- Includes interactive control props (e.g., allowChildInteraction, closeOnChildInteraction) for tailored user interaction experiences.

## Disadvantages
- Increases setup complexity with multiple state variables (e.g., defaultTipVisible) and onClose event handling.
- May introduce performance overhead, especially with Modal usage or extensive styling on low-end devices.
- Lacks comprehensive documentation, making it challenging to address edge cases or implement advanced features.
